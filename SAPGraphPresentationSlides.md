# SAP Graph in Integration Suite
## Unified API Access to All Your SAP Business Data

One API to rule them all—access S/4HANA, SuccessFactors, Ariba, and Sales Cloud through a single endpoint.

---

# The Multi-System Integration Problem

**Every SAP developer struggles with this:**

🔌 **API Sprawl**
Different API for every system | S/4HANA uses one format, SuccessFactors uses another | Connecting to each system separately

📚 **Complexity Overload**
Learning multiple data formats (REST, OData v2, SOAP) | Managing different authentication methods | Maintaining numerous connections

🔍 **Data Navigation Nightmare**
Finding related data across systems | Customer in one place, orders in another | Manual joins and data stitching required

**There's a unified approach to access all your SAP data.**

---

# Our Solution: SAP Graph Business Data Layer

**A single API for your entire SAP landscape:**

🗺️ **Business Data Graph**
Connected map of 1,500+ business entities | Customer → Product → SalesOrder relationships | Navigate data like exploring a graph database

⚡ **Unified API Standards**
OData v4 and GraphQL support | Consistent query syntax across all systems | Single authentication flow for multiple backends

🔗 **Multi-System Connectivity**
SAP S/4HANA | SAP SuccessFactors | SAP Ariba | SAP Sales Cloud | All through one endpoint

**Result:** Write once, access everywhere—no more learning different APIs.
